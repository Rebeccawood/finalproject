SpeakEasy is a language exchange app, which connects people who speak a certain language with people who are learning that language and vice versa. You can edit your preferences to look for gender and age range. The tool automatically searches for people in your city, who speak the languages you are learning.
You can also have the option to signup as or search for teachers.
Once you have had a look at someones profile, you can message them privately for a meeting. Your messages will be saved, so you can return to the chat.
